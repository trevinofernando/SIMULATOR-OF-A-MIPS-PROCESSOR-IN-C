# SIMULATOR-OF-A-MIPS-PROCESSOR-IN-C

Developers: 
-
Sarah Angell and Fernando Trevino (myself). 

Programing Language: 
-
C and Assembly. Description: In this project, I wrote the core part of a mini processor simulator called “MySPIM” using C language on a PC platform. The program demonstrates some functions of the MIPS processor as well as the principle of the data-path and the control signals of MIPS processor. The simulator read in a file containing MIPS machine codes and simulate what the MIPS does cycle-by-cycle. 

Benefit: 
-
Learning purposes and mastery of MIPS.
